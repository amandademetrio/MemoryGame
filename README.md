# Memory Game

This is a classic memory game in which the user has to find the two cards with the same image inside --in this case, the images are brands. The goal of the game is to finish it with the least possible amount of moves and time.

## Getting Started

## About the game

You play by turning two cards around (by clicking on them). If they match, they will turn green and start turned. If they don't match, they'll turn red and flip back around.

Everytime the game is loaded the cards are positioned differently. The timer starts as soon as you load the page. You start the game with a 3 stars ratings and zero moves. As the number of moves increases, the star ratings decrease.

You win when all the cards in your board are green. You should get a little pop-up modal when you win, giving you your game stats and asking if you want to play again. If you want to play again, click on "Yes" and the game should be reset. If you click on "No", you go back to your green-filled board.

At anytime, you can reset the game by clicking on the Reset button.
